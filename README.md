Reinforcement Learning is one of the most important types of Machine Learning. The basic concept of Reinforcement learning is an Agent which learns how to behave in an environment by performing actions and receiving awards for its actions. OpenAI Gym provides various problems (environments) for reinforcement learning. The “Classic Control” problems are the combination of mechanics and reinforcement learning. Three “Classic Control” environments were chosen to demonstrate how reinforcement learning and Q Learning and Deep Q networks can be applied.
